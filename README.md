## About

**aruco-object-drop** is a robust framework designed for real-time ArUco marker detection and tracking on UAVs in outdoor environments, making it ideal for object dropping missions. Developed for [IMAV 2024](https://2024.imavs.org/), this project is centered around the theme of wildlife preservation and aims to enhance precision and robustness in challenging environments.

## Getting Started

To begin using **aruco-object-drop**, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow the instructions below to get everything up and running smoothly.

### Prerequisites

Before you can use **aruco-object-drop**, ensure you have the following tools installed:

#### 1. **Install `pyenv`**

`pyenv` helps manage multiple Python versions on your system. To install `pyenv`, follow these steps:

1. **Install `pyenv` using pip**:
    ```bash
    pip install pyenv
    ```

2. **Set the global Python version**:
    ```bash
    pyenv install 3.12.4
    pyenv global 3.12.4
    ```

For more information on `pyenv`, visit the [pyenv GitHub page](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

#### 2. **Install `Poetry`**

`Poetry` is a dependency management tool for Python that simplifies package management and project setup.

1. **Install `Poetry` using pip**:
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    ```

2. **Configure `Poetry` to use the installed Python version** (if necessary):
    ```bash
    poetry env use $(pyenv which python)
    ```

For detailed instructions and more options, refer to the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

After installing both `pyenv` and `poetry`, you will be ready to install the project dependencies and start using **aruco-object-drop**!


### Installation

Now that your development environment is set up, you are ready to install **aruco-object-drop**. Follow these steps to set up the project and get it running on your local machine:

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**

    Begin by cloning the **aruco-object-drop** repository from GitHub to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kmalkow/aruco-object-drop.git
    ```

#### 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Once the cloning process is complete, change your working directory to the newly cloned project folder. 
    
    ```bash
    cd aruco-object-drop
    ```

#### 3. **Install Dependencies**

    Once you are in the working directory, install the project‚Äôs dependencies using Poetry.

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

#### 4. **Activate Virtual Environment**

    After installing the dependencies, activate the virtual environment using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

    And exit the virtual environment using the following command:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```
    
    These commands activate and exit the virtual environment, allowing you to work with the project's dependencies in isolation from your global Python environment.

#### 5. **Verify the Installation**

   To verify whether the project dependencies are installed correctly, run the following command:

    ```bash
    poetry show
    ```

    If it shows the same __main__ dependencies as in the `pyproject.toml` file, then everything has been installed correctly.

Well done! The **aruco-object-drop** project is now installed correctly and ready for use. If you encounter any issues, seek assistance through the [contact page](#contact).
